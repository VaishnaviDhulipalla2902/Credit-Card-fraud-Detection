# Credit-Card-fraud-Detection
Objective: Create a model/approach to predict which credit card transactions could be fraudulent based on patterns identification from historical data Problem Statement and Approach Data: One year of credit card transaction data for various accounts is shared • Training Data : Data for identifying the pattern with tagged Fraudulent transactions • Testing Data:  Data for evaluating the performance without tagged Fraudulent transactions 
Success Criteria: The predictions on Testing Data will be matched with known Fraudulent transactions along with overall approach 

But, I have done only Data Analysis and Feature Engineering part of it.
